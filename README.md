# Planetary-motion-project

Overview
This project simulates the motion of planets in a solar system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application visually demonstrates the gravitational interaction between the Sun and its orbiting planets, showing their elliptical paths around the star. Users can explore how different parameters (like orbital speed, distance from the Sun, and more) affect the planets' orbits.

Features:-
1:Realistic Orbital Simulation: Simulates planetary motion using Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion.
2:Interactive Controls: Adjust the speed of simulation, change the mass of the Sun, or add/remove planets.
3:Multiple Planets: Includes several planets, each with unique orbital characteristics.
4:Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:-
HTML5: For structuring the layout of the web application.
CSS3: For styling the application and ensuring a clean and responsive design.
JavaScript: For simulating the planetary motion and handling user interactions.
