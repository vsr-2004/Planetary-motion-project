# Planetary-motion-project

Overview
This project simulates the motion of planets in a solar system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application visually demonstrates the gravitational interaction between the Sun and its orbiting planets, showing their elliptical paths around the star. Users can explore how different parameters (like orbital speed, distance from the Sun, and more) affect the planets' orbits.

Features
Realistic Orbital Simulation: Simulates planetary motion using Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion.
Interactive Controls: Adjust the speed of simulation, change the mass of the Sun, or add/remove planets.
Multiple Planets: Includes several planets, each with unique orbital characteristics.
Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the layout of the web application.
CSS3: For styling the application and ensuring a clean and responsive design.
JavaScript: For simulating the planetary motion and handling user interactions.
Canvas API: Used to render the planets and their orbits in real-time.
Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Open the index.html file in your browser to launch the simulation.
Use the available controls on the page to start the simulation and experiment with different settings.
